# Online-Shopping
Online Shopping Application is a database-driven web application built as a DBMS mini-project. It can be run using local servers like XAMPP and uses PHP and MySQL for backend operations. The project simulates a simple e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and manage shopping activities.
